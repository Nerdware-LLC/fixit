# REST Schema: PreFetchedUserItems

type: object
description: |
  A User's pre-fetched WorkOrders, Invoices, and Contacts (used on logins). When fetched
  by the `queryUserItems` middleware (see `src/middleware/auth/queryUserItems.ts`), these
  objects are made available on Express `res.locals` objects under the key `userItems`.

  Note: the middleware converts workOrders' and invoices' internal `createdByUserID` and
  `assignedToUserID` fields into `createdBy` and `assignedTo` objects to match the GQL
  schema, but only the `"id"` field can be provided on the createdBy/assignedTo objects
  without fetching additional data on the associated users/contacts from either the db or
  usersCache. The middleware forgoes fetching the data since the client-side Apollo cache
  already handles fetching additional data as needed (_if_ it's needed), and fetching it
  there can delay auth request response times, especially if the authenticating user has
  a large number of items.
